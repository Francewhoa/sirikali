To create a custom backend using a GUI, press "CTRL+B" while SiriKali has focus to
get a GUI window that will allow you to create a custom backend confuguration file.
The file will be created in user's home folder in Linux and Macos in user's desktop
folder in Windows.

Manual changes to the configuration file may be necessary to further customise
the backend since the GUI window does not expose all available options.

On startup, SiriKail checks for custom backend in "$HOME/.config/SiriKali/backends"
and in "$INSTALL_PREFIX/share/SiriKali/backends".
